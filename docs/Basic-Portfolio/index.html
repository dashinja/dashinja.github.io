          <p>"Mr. ?" ... Byron. James Byron.</p>
          <p>Not often is a man viewed to have the demeanor
              and suspected skill of a famed spy, nor the mysterious
              clout and efficiency of a ninja.
          </p>
  
          <p>These titles and more adorn the name of Byron Miller,
              who is otherwise described as cordial though self-kept,
              smooth spoken though tight-lipped, abudantly kind while
              reserved, and though in high demand - present when needed.
          </p>
  
          <p>I graduated from Davidson College in 2009, having majored
              in the Art and Science of being Myself. I also left with
              a piece of paper reading 'Spanish Literature', that is,
              if you could read the Latin.
          </p>
  
          <p>I enjoy the world of technology and currently employ those
              skills in the proud and magical world of stagecraft, functioning
              as the Theatrical Master Electrician in the illustrious Duke Family
              Performance Hall (DFPH) of my Alma Mater. The experiences in show business
              are myriad and unique. I have learned much in and continue to contribute
              to the ever evolving Entertainment industry.
          </p>
  
          <p>When I'm not commanding the Lighting Department in preparation for Stephen
              Curry's return visit to Davidson (You gotta look good when all those TV
              cameras stare you down), programming away on the baby (ETC Ion Lighting Control Desk),
              nor exercising hard earned language skills with some of our Spanish speaking
              staff at our diverse institution... 
          </p>
          <p>
              I enjoy
            <ul>
                <li>Learning</li>
                <li>Thinking</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Conversation</li>
                <li>Eating</li>
                <li>Sleeping</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
  
          <p>In as much as that list is generic and boring, it is every bit true
              that while Bond appears in the middle of action, the instigator of
              menacing intrigue, and even some fictional success as a low-key ladies' man -
              all this and more comes from his ability to enjoy the simple things
              in life. </br>
  
              I have learned that one must be present to enjoy the present,
              the people of the present, the opportunities present...
              for truly, there is no time but the present.
